# 🎮 Godot Learning Journey

This project is a sandbox for me to learn how to build games in **Godot Engine**, while also trying to create modules that will help me in developing future games.

## 🎯 Goals
1. **Recreate games**
   - Rebuild games (Pong, Snake, etc) 
   - Get familiar with working with Godot Engine
2. **Create Modular Libraries**
   - Develop reusable, "plug-and-play" modules
   - Aim for clean, modular and reusable code with good abstraction
3. **Experiment with Godot's Features**
   - Explore how to do stuff using Godot's capabilities 
   - Create mini-projects to practice specific features

## 📂 Project Structure

Here's how the repository is organized:
```bash
.
├───assets			# Assets shared across multiple games
├───games			# Individual games
└───modules			# Reusable modules for games
    ├───2d			# Modules specific to 2D Games
    ├───3d			# Modules specific to 3D Games
    └───general		# Modules that can be used in either 2D or 3D games
```

## 💡 Why I Created This

I believe that learning by doing is the best way to master new skills. By creating multiple games and reusable modules, I'm not only learning how to use the Godot Engine effectively but also developing good coding practices like modularity, abstraction, and reusability.
